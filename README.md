```bash
git clone https://github.com/kelvin-ahiakpor/Ashesi.FTP.Sync.git
cd Ashesi.FTP.Sync
```

### 2. Usage
- **macOS/Linux**: 
    You may refer to the [macOS README](./README.md)
    Run the `sync_to_ftp.sh` file by navigating to its directory and executing:
    ```bash
    cd macOS
    chmod +x sync_to_ftp.sh
    ./sync_to_ftp.sh #strictly for your first run!
    ```

    ```bash
    ./sync_to_ftp.sh & #subsequent runs can be in background with the added &
    ```

- **Windows**: 
    You may refer to the [Windows README](./README.md)

## Troubleshooting

1. **Configuration Issues**:
   - If incorrect details were entered during setup, remove the configuration file:
     - macOS: `rm ~/Development/scripts/sync_config.conf`
     - Windows: `Remove-Item -Path "$HOME\Development\scripts\sync_config.conf"`
   - Run the script again to reconfigure.

2. **Sync Issues**:
   - Ensure tools (`lftp`, `fswatch`, or WinSCP`) are properly installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

3. **Browser Cache**:
   - On macOS, hard refresh with **Cmd + Shift + R** or **Ctrl + F5** to see updated server files.
